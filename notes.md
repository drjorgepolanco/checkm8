The images of the bags where not available in the links.
I google the bags with the item number available in the links, perfectly 
cleaned the backgrounds in photoshop to allow transparency, cropped the images,
and insert the in the ad.

Interact is bugged.
It works as expected as long as the user doesn't leave the container.
Once the user leaves the container it collapses.
